# Black Holes in Quadratic Gravity

Hyun Lim and Aaron Held

We study some possible dynamical black holes in 
Quadratic gravity. Out interests foucus on stability
problem and possible gravitational wave signals in this
theory. We consider 3+1 decomposition to enable dynamical
studies. Also, we analyze structure of the equations of
motion from the theory and possible effective field theory
apporoach to have linearized version of system. Numerical
simulations of this system would be performed by `HAD`
toolkit (Will be added).

`notes` directory contains theory/formulation for this project

`scripts` directory contains `Mathematica` file that peforms 3+1
decomposition of the equations. It is saved in `Wolfram Language`
format. Users need a Wolfram compatible program such as`Mathematica`
or `WolframOne` etc.

Several references explain about the project. You can find
