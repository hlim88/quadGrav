# Black Holes in Quadratic Gravity

Hyun Lima and Aaron Held

We study some possible dynamical black holes in 
Quadratic gravity. Out interests foucus on stability
problem and possible gravitational wave signals in this
theory. We consider 3+1 decomposition to enable dynamical
studies. Also, we analyze structure of the equations of
motion from the theory and possible effective field theory
apporoach to have linearized version of system.
